Day 1
Learning Git

# change directory to codebase
$ cd /file/path/to/code

# make directory a git repository
$ git init

# add git file or directory
$ git add <file or directory name>

# Commit changes to head (but not yet to the remote repository):
git commit -m "Commit message"

# Commit any files you've added with git add, and also commit any files you've changed since then:
git commit -a

# Send changes to the master branch of your remote repository:	
git push origin master
